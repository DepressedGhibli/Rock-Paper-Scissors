# Rock-Paper-Scissors
 A simple game of Quartz- Parchment-Shares.

 the "getComputerChoice()" fuction returns either rock paper or sissors.
 I achieved this by using math fuctions to generate a random number between 0 and 2 then using if else statements to return on of rock paper or sissors.

 the "getPlayerChoice()" function simply prompts the user for a string and converts it to lower case, returning that value.

 the "playRound()" function conducts a single round of rock paper siccors taking in the values from the getPlayerChoice and getComputerChoice functions, returning a different message if either the player wins or loses or there is a tie.

 the "game" fuction iterates through the playerRound function up to 100 times until either the player or computer has reaced 5 wins at which point the function will return the winner.
